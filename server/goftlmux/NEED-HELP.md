# Need Help - Shamelss Plug

Yes!

I need some help.  I need remote development work in Go (golang),
Node.js or AngularJS.  Even better would be a full-stack project.
I am in a small town in Wyoming.  I can be on-site up to 1 week per
month in the continental United States.   If you are in the Denver,
Boulder, Ft Collins area then I may be able to be on site more
often.  I have to be in Wyoming to take care of my 90 year old blind
mother.

So...

I am an experienced developer, manager, former-CEO, former-CTO.  My
technical background includes Go, C, C++, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3,
Perl, Python, PHP, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle and lots of other
stuff.  I have been programming, running projects and building
software companies for 30 years.

Yes I am that old!  I started in Fortran-77 on paper punch cards.
I am not antiquated or out of date.

If you can help out with part time, full time, some time, then...
