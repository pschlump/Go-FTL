<h1>BasicAuthRedis: Basic Auth using Redis</h1>

<p>This middleware implements HTTP basic auth with the authorization stored in Redis.</p>

<p>The package used to access the Redis database is:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/garyburd/redigo/redis
</code></pre>

<p>Pbkdf2 is used to help prevent cracking via rainbow tables.  Each hashed password
is strengthened by using salt and 5,000 iterations of Pbkdf2 with a sha256 hash.</p>

<p>Basic auth should only be used in conjunction with TLS (https).  If you need to use
an authentication scheme with http, or you want a better authentication scheme,
take a look at the aessrp.go  middleware.  There are examples of using it with
jQuery and AngularJS 1.3 (2.0 of AngularJS coming soon).</p>

<p>Also this is &ldquo;basic auth&rdquo; with the ugly browser popup of username/password and no
real error reporting to the user.  If you want something better switch to the SRP/AES
solution.</p>

<p>Remember that rainbow tables can crack MD5 hashes in less than 30 seconds 95%
of the time.  So&hellip; this is only &ldquo;basic&rdquo; auth - with low security.</p>

<p>So what is &ldquo;basic&rdquo; auth really good for?  Simple answer.  If you need just a
touch of secruity - and no more.   Example:  You took a video of your children
and you want to send it to Grandma.  It is too big for her email so
you need to send a link. So quick copy it up to your server and set basic
auth on the directory/path.  Send her the link and the username and password.
This keeps googlebot and other nosy folks out of it - but it is not really
secure.  Then a couple of days later you delete the video.   Works like a
champ!</p>

<p>There is a command line tool in ../../tools/user-redis/user-redis.go to maintain the data
in the Redis database.  You can create/update/delete users from the database.  Also the
tool is useful for verifying that you can connect to the database.</p>

<p>The database connection information is in the global-cfg.json file.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>For the paths that you want to protect with this turn on basic auth.  In the server configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>{ &quot;BasicAuthRedis&quot;: {
    &quot;Paths&quot;: [ &quot;/video/children&quot;, &quot;/family/pictures&quot; ],
    &quot;Realm&quot;: &quot;example.com&quot;
} },
</code></pre>

<p>A sample setup for Redis is in: <code>redis-setup.redis</code>.  To run</p>

<pre><code>$ redis-cli &lt;redis-setup.redis
</code></pre>

<p>To run this you must have valid connection info in ../test_redis.json.</p>
