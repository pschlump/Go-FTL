Limit the bandwith of a particular requestor

1. Must have an "AuthToken" - this determines what the limit is.

2. Limit will be to a frequency - save the data for this AuthToken with an expire in Redis
	- if not fouind in redis then OK, create new limit-bandwitdth token
	- if found then
		return error 429(default configurable) "Too Many Requests"
			509 "Bandwidth Limit Exceeded" -- unoficall

would be nice to confiure as N/per-sec 


Add in limit-via-delay - with 1500 ms delay?, 1st no delay, then if a 2nd before timeout, Sleep for pexpire delay ms.
