<h1>BasicAuth: Implement Basic Authentication Using a .htaccess File</h1>

<p>This middleware implements HTTP basic auth with the authorization stored in a flat file.
If you need to use a database for the storage of usernames/passwords, then you should look
at one of the other two basic-auth middlware.   If you are looking for an example of how
to use a relational database, or how to use a non-relational database, the other basic-auth
middlware are recomended.</p>

<p>Basic auth should only be used in conjunction with TLS (https).  If you need to use
an authentication scheme with http, or you want a better authentication scheme
take a look at the auth_srp.go  middleware.  There are examples of using it with
jQuery and AngularJS 1.3 (2.0 of AngularJS coming soon).</p>

<p>Also this is &ldquo;basic auth&rdquo; with the ugly browser popup of username/password and no
real error reporting to the user.  If you want something better, switch to the SRP/AES
solution.</p>

<p>Remember that rainbow tables can crack MD5 hashes in less than 30 seconds 95%
of the time.  So&hellip; this is only &ldquo;basic&rdquo; auth - with low security.</p>

<p>So what is &ldquo;basic&rdquo; auth really good for?  Simple answer.  If you need just a
touch of secruity - and no more.   Example:  You took a video of your children
and you want to send it to Grandma.  It is too big for her email so
you need to send a link.  So do a quick copy of it up to your server and set basic
auth on the directory/path.  Send her the link and the username and password.
This keeps googlebot and other nosy folks out of it - but it is not really
secure.  Then a couple of days later you delete the video.   Works like a
champ!</p>

<p>There is a command line tool in ./cli-tools/htaccess to maintain the .htaccess
file with the usernames and hashed passwords.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>For the paths that you want to protect with this turn on basic auth.  In the server configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>{ &quot;BasicAuth&quot;: {
    &quot;Paths&quot;: [ &quot;/video/children&quot;, &quot;/family/pictures&quot; ],
    &quot;Realm&quot;: &quot;myserver.com&quot;
} },
</code></pre>

<p>With the &ldquo;AuthName&rdquo; you can set the name of the authorization file.  It defaults to .htaccess in the current directory.</p>

<pre><code>{ &quot;BasicAuth&quot;: {
    &quot;Paths&quot;: [ &quot;/video/children&quot;, &quot;/family/pictures&quot; ],
    &quot;Realm&quot;: &quot;myserver.com&quot;,
    &quot;AuthName&quot;: &quot;/etc/go-ftl-cfg/htaccess.conf&quot;
} },
</code></pre>

<p>If you use this middleware it will also ban fetching .htaccess or whatever you have set for AuthName as a file.</p>

<h2>Full Example</h2>

<pre><code>{
     &quot;www.zepher.com&quot;: { &quot;LineNo&quot;:2,
        &quot;listen_to&quot;:[ &quot;http://www.zepher.com:3210/&quot; ],
        &quot;plugins&quot;:[
            { &quot;BasicAuth&quot;: {
                &quot;Paths&quot;: [ &quot;/private1&quot;, &quot;/private2&quot; ],
                &quot;Realm&quot;: &quot;zepher.com&quot;,
                &quot;AuthName&quot;: &quot;/Users/corwin/go/src/github.com/pschlump/Go-FTL/server/midlib/basicauth/htaccess.conf&quot;
            } },
            { &quot;file_server&quot;: { &quot;LineNo&quot;:9,
                &quot;Root&quot;:&quot;./www.zepher.com__3210&quot;,
                &quot;Paths&quot;:&quot;/&quot;
            } }
        ]
    }
}
</code></pre>
