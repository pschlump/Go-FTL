<h1>BasicAuthPgSql: Basic Auth Using PostgreSQL</h1>

<p>This middleware implements HTTP basic auth with the authorization stored in PostgreSQL.</p>

<p>The PG package used to access the database is:</p>

<pre><code>https://github.com/jackc/pgx
</code></pre>

<p>Pbkdf2 is used to help prevent cracking via rainbow tables.  Each hashed password
is strengthened by using salt and 5,000 iterations of Pbkdf2 with a sha256 hash.</p>

<p>Basic auth should only be used in conjunction with TLS (https).  If you need to use
an authentication scheme with http, or you want a better authentication scheme,
take a look at the aessrp.go  middleware.  There are examples of using it with
jQuery and AngularJS 1.3 (2.0 of AngularJS coming soon).</p>

<p>Also this is &ldquo;basic auth&rdquo; with the ugly browser popup of username/password and no
real error reporting to the user.  If you want something better switch to the SRP/AES
solution.</p>

<p>Remember that rainbow tables can crack MD5 hashes in less than 30 seconds 95%
of the time.  So&hellip; this is only &ldquo;basic&rdquo; auth - with low security.</p>

<p>So what is &ldquo;basic&rdquo; auth really good for?  Simple answer.  If you need just a
touch of secruity - and no more.   Example:  You took a video of your children
 and you want to send it to Grandma.  It is too big for her email so
you need to send a link.  So quick copy it up to your server and set basic
auth on the directory/path.  Send her the link and the username and password.
This keeps googlebot and other nosy folks out of it - but it is not really
secure.  Then a couple of days later you delete the video.   Works like a
champ!</p>

<p>There is a command line tool in ../../../tools/user-pgsql/user-pgsql.go to maintain the data
in the PostgreSQL database.  You can create/update/delete users from the database.  Also the
tool is useful for verifying that you can connect to the database.</p>

<p>The database connection information is in the global-cfg.json file.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>For the paths that you want to protect with this turn on basic auth.  In the server configuration file:</p>

<pre><code>    { &quot;BasicAuthPgSql&quot;: {
        &quot;Paths&quot;: [ &quot;/video/children&quot;, &quot;/family/pictures&quot; ],
        &quot;Realm&quot;: &quot;example.com&quot;
    } },
</code></pre>

<p>SQL Configuration Script</p>

<p>The setup script to create the table in the database is in &hellip;/Go-FTL/server/midlib/basicpgsql/user-setup.sql.
You will need to modify this file and run this before using the middleware.  The realm in the &ldquo;username&rdquo; field
is &ldquo;example.com&rdquo;.  That will need to match the realm you are using in your configuration.</p>

<pre><code>-- drop TABLE &quot;basic_auth&quot; ;
CREATE TABLE &quot;basic_auth&quot; (
      &quot;username&quot;                char varying (200) not null primary key
    , &quot;salt&quot;                    char varying (100) not null
    , &quot;password&quot;                char varying (180) not null 
);

delete from &quot;basic_auth&quot; where &quot;username&quot; = 'example.com:testme';
insert into &quot;basic_auth&quot; ( &quot;username&quot;, &quot;salt&quot;, &quot;password&quot; ) values ( 'example.com:testme', 'salt', 
    '9b6095510e3e1c0ea568c3faf29e545c364265d017b16614b1a2de3efe96bc6313cb9e1d221134a46fd5faa8499ebb8568a2ec489e32fa4c4adcd89c05394292'
);
