	1. if 2fa data exists - then - update/add, else new.
		xyzzy900
	2. Relocate: // xyzzy901 - relocate to app at this point.

remeber 1 time keys need to be saved in local storage when we do setup.

0. Test in this -then- make work w/ Registration stuff
	1. 2fa-setup stuff
	2. Intermediate state - not completed registration until 2fa setup

Current user_id is returned to the client - 
	1. May need to remove this at PostProcess
	2. Use user_id to setup-2fa if turned on
	3. check in registration if 2fa is on, then set state of register to 'temporary'
		until 2fa is completed.



7. Write the HTML/progressive APP for this.
9. - how do we validate this in - "Login" call? - PG/SQL - need to put valid data into PG so Postgres Code can validate this.
	1. List of valid #s
	2. Use a Number, delete it.
	3. Timeout on nubmers - 1 time keys in this with a no-timeout date
	4. Add in code in s_login 
	5. Add in 2fa param
	6. Must have a "valid-login" flag in it - so can do push button validation.
		- how to prevent 2nd login on this validation -
		t_user.wait_for_validation == 'yes'?
		-- Can only work if "push" data (Socket.IO/WebSocket)????
		-- Can only work if 2nd page for require 2fa
7. 2fa config - every login / X number of days valid device etc.


1. Create the API for setup
	2. Add in the Redis to use ID -> hash
	3. Report if timed out.
	4. Add in a page - to do setup with entered ID.
	5. Reprot errors

2. Create the API for pull of 2 min HASH value.
	/2fa/pull-2-min-hash

3. Create the API call/library for validate of entered 6 digit number
	/2fa/is-valid-2fa?id=, user=, 

4. Remember 1 time codes
	/2fa/generate-1-time-codes?fmt=list fmt=pdf
		-> codes as JSON, url of PDF of codes
	/2fa/n-remain-1-time-codes



x2fa.go - 2fa support

*0. Pull random generation code - Put in Package "ftlran"
	*1. Gen Ran Int
	*2. Gen Ran Bytes
	*3. Hexify byte[]
*2. Find correct header for HTML content type
*3. Find code for pulling and using QR code
*4. Find code for update to t432z.com  - set URL for QR - Package "setqr"
*5. Generate 1st part - QR + text in Div
*6. Generate 2nd part - the redirect for setup
*8. /api/2fa APIs - write them

1. msetup.html 
	1. pull id
	2. set in local storage
	3. Add form + button
	4. on submit - jump to 2fa-app.html
2. setup.html?id=
	1. pull id
	2. set in local storage
	3. Add form + button
	4. on submit - jump to 2fa-app.html

	- This is "generated" - where ? why ? how ?
	- Everything on URL for this

	At end of msetup.html/setup.html local storage should have
		{"URL":{"hash":"value"}} in it.

	from ID to Hash - make API call using ID
		Call w/ ID to set FP for this user.
			dispatch["/api/x2fa/set-fp"] = dispatchType{
			-- Should return the "HASH" for the local storage???
			-- Could also return the "URL" for the msetup.html/setup.html file???



ID=iiiiiii - Id to lookup in Redis on server that has
	1. Hash - generated on server at this point
	2. Fp - Calcualte and send from msetup.html/setup.html -> server API using "id"
	3. T2faID - only used on server - relate ID to PG t_2fa data
	4. UserID - only used on server - relate ID to PG t_user data

		type RedisData struct {
			Hash   string `json:"hash"`
			Fp     string `json:"fp"`
			T2faID string `json:"t_2fa_id"`
			UserID string `json:"user_id"`

	How to get from "id" -> URL for local storage?							<<<< Q >>>>
	
	Answered: from ID to fp - use fingerprint2 code.
