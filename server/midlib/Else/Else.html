<h1>Else: Return a Page for a Failed Virtual Host Name or SNI Match</h1>

<p>It is possible that a server will receive requests that do not match any name or IP address.
An example would be a new, or unconfigured DNS name, that maps to the current IP address of
the Go-FTL server.  If an <code>Else</code> middleware is used, then a list of resolvable names
will be displayed to the user and the user can click on one of the links.</p>

<p>There is only 1 <code>Else</code> for all named servers.  Usually it is placed at the bottom of the
configuration file.</p>

<h2>Configuration</h2>

<p>Not much configuration.  The only option is to have a message that displays before the
list of configured servers.</p>

<pre><code>{
    ...
    ...
    ...
    ...
    &quot;elseServer&quot;: { 
        &quot;listen_to&quot;:[ &quot;*&quot; ],
        &quot;plugins&quot;:[
            { &quot;Else&quot;: { 
                &quot;Paths&quot;:   &quot;/&quot;,
                &quot;Msg&quot;: &quot;&lt;h1&gt; This is the Go-FTL server for: &lt;/h1&gt;&quot;
            } }
}
