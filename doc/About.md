Go-FTL is a web server and forward proxy.  It is licensed so that you can use it in embedded systems.  It is written in Go (golang) so that it is easy to modify and easy to deploy.
The ultimate goal is a full stack web-development environment that makes it easy to build and maintain web applications that use a database on the back end.

Go-FTL was started in 2015 but uses code that has been under development for a decade or more.
